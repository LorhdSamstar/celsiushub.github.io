            <h1>What is Temperature</h2>
                <p>Temperature is the measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several scales,
                    including Fahrenheit and Celsius, Temeperature indicates the direction in wchich heat energy will
                    spontaneously flow-i.e., from a hotter body (one at a higher temperature) to a colder body 
                    (one at a lower temperature).

            <h1>Temperature Scale</h2>
                <p>Three temperature scales are in general use today. The Fahrenheit (F) temperature scale is used in the
                    United States and a few English-speaking countries. The Celsius (C) temperature scale is standard in virtually
                    all countries taht have adopted the metric system of measurement, and it is widely used in the sciences.
                    The Kelvin (K) scale, an absolute temperature scale (Obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by -273.15
                    so that absoolute temperature zero coincides with 0K), is recognized as the international standard for
                    scientific temperature measurement.<br>
                    In certain fields of engineering, another absoilute tempearture scale, the Rankine scale is preffered 
                    over the Kelvin scale. Its unit of measure=the degree Rankine(R)-equals the Fahrenheit degree, as the Kelvin
                    equals one Celsius degree.
